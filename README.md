# AutoHoldClick
Simple app that holds your left clicked pressed!

With standby mode activated press the left click once and it will be like you never released it. To stop holding click left, just click once.
Then, keep the middle button in order to deactivate standby mode.

##Permissions
For **Windows** you are good to go out of the box.
For **macOS** you will need to give the app permission for 'Input Monitoring' and 'Accesibility'.
